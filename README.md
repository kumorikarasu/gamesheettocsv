# CSV

Simple app to take a google sheet and format it to a correct CSV file to import it into photoshop. 

## Reason Why
Certain fields need to be quoted to keep formating as otherwise photoshop trims the input. This also lets me update the csv file much faster


### Future
Is it possible to also have a script that will auto import it into photoshop and export the final PSDs?
